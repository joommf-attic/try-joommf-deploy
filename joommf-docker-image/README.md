# Info

The Docker image that is created here is the one that is fired up for
every user of the Jupyter Hub instance.

So any example notebooks that the users are meant to see need to be
added here.

Targets in the Makefile:

- `build_docker` to create docker image

- `push_docker` to push that image to dockerhub
